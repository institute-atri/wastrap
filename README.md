WASTRAP is a web exploration tool focused on the WordPress application.

Being fast and simple, it has functionality that an information security professional cannot fail to have in their
arsenal. With vulnerability analysis in themes, plugins and others, it also has brute-force in directories, users and
much more (see more features in the official documentation).
